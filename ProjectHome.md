# Dump to String #

## Introduction ##
A simple utility class which dumps the content of a object to String.
It is very useful when you simply want to display the content of a object.
E.g., when use JAX-WS of Java 6, all of the auto-generated class never overwrite the method of `toString`. However, you can not modify the content of auto-generated class. Because they will be re-generated in the future. **Dump to String** is just a simple class with a static method. It uses java reflection to parse the content of an object an generates a `String` by `StringBuilder`

## Usage ##
```
public void testTestObjectList() {
    System.out.println("testObjectList");
    TestObjectListResult result = TestObjectListProvider.testObjectList();
    List<TestObjectType> testObjects = result.getTestObjects();
    for (TestObjectType testObject : testObjects) {
        System.out.println(DumpToString.dump(testObject));
    }
}
```
Note: TestObjectType is a complex type which was auto-generated by `wsimport`.
